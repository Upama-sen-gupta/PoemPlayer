    <string name="poem1">Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are</string>

    <string name="poem2">Rainbow Rainbow, high and bright.
Rainbow rainbow, made of light.
From the clouds to the ground,
I see colors all around.

Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue
Indigo and Violet too
Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue
Indigo and Violet too.

and early to rise,
makes a man
healthy wealthy
and wise</string>
